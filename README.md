Javascript AudioFX (v0.0.1)
===========================

Experimenting with a tiny library to abstract away the complications with HTML5 Audio.

Similar to [buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) but simpler and include support
for pools of audio tags (for short FX that need to be played multiple overlapping times)

Very Early experimentation, no documentation or blog articles yet.

YMMV
