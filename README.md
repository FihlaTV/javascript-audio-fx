Javascript AudioFX (v0.0.1)
===========================

Experimenting with a tiny library to abstract away the complications with HTML5 Audio.

Similar to [buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) but simpler and include support
for pools of audio tags (for short FX that need to be played multiple overlapping times)...

... I should probably just be forking buzz and trying to add pooling support to it, but 
I haven't had the time yet.

Very Early experimentation, no documentation or blog articles yet.

YMMV
